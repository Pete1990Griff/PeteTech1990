👋 Hi, I’m Pete (@PeteTech1990)

💻 I'm a Software Engineer based in Wales, UK, with a background in SysAdmin but with a growing passion for coding.

🎓 Currently finishing my BSc in Software Engineering at the University of Wales, Bangor. (Hopefully completed 07/2025)

🛠️ My tech stack includes C#, .NET (WinForms, WPF, MAUI), HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, YAML and Python. But I'm eager to give anything a go.

🔍 I'm also interested in bridging the gap between SysAdmin expertise and Software Engineering, finding ways to automate and improve workflows.

🤖 Sci-fi fan and firm believer that problems can be solved with Christ-like grace, patience, and the occasional "turn it off and on again."
