- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PeteTech1990 (Pete)

- I'm currently working as an IT Manager at a Secondary school, in Wales, UK and I'm currently studying Bsc Software Engineering at Coleg Cambria.

- I have a experience with coding, having done a programming modules at college and Uni, and having built solutions for home and for work. My skills including using WinForms, WPF, .Net MAUI, C#, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and python. 

- ðŸ‘€ I also think a possible direction for me would be to combine what I know from SysAdmin with what I am learning in Software Engineering. I.e looking into DevOps careers and even introducing it at my current job. 

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... via email, peterkeithgriffiths@gmail.com
