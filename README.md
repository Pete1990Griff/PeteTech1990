- 👋 Hi, I’m @PeteTech1990 (Pete)

- I'm currently working as an IT Manager at a Secondary school, in Wales, UK. I enjoy the job, but I feel its far too general and I've always loved the idea of going into software development.

- I have a little experience with coding, having done a programming module at college and having built a couple of WinForms projects myself for home and for work. I can code fairly well in C# because of this.

- 👀 I’m interested in starting a new career in software development, but am unsure what sort of discipline I want to go into. At the time of writing, web development seems to be where the money is, but I'm not sure that's what I want to do. After watching a few "how to start" videos and reading some articles, I believe the best place to start will be Python. This seems to have multiple benefits, including:
- 1. Being a language used in multiple disciplines, so I can try out a few projects in different areas
- 2. Being a good beginner langauge, to refresh my knowledge of programming concepts
- 3. They use it at the school that I work at, so I would be able to better support the staff and students while I am still working there

- 🌱 So that's where I'm at for now. I'm going to try a few online courses to begin with, in coding concepts, Python and computer science. Plus I have a "Beginners guide to Python" book that a teacher has leant me from work. Excited to start!!!!!!

- 💞️ As I progress, I would love to collaberate on pretty much anything, to get a feel of what I am really into, and to realise where to go next, after Python.
