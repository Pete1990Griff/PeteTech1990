- 👋 Hi, I’m @PeteTech1990 (Pete)

- I'm currently working as an IT Manager at a Secondary school, in Wales, UK and I'm currently studying Bsc Software Engineering at Coleg Cambria.

- I have a little experience with coding, having done a programming module at college and having built a couple of WinForms projects myself for home and for work. I can code fairly well in C# because of this and am currently learning Python at college.

- 👀 I’m interested in starting a new career in software development, but am unsure what sort of discipline I want to go into. At the time of writing, web development seems to be where the money is, but I'm not sure that's what I want to do. After watching a few "how to start" videos and reading some articles, I believe the best place to start will be Python. This seems to have multiple benefits, including:
- 1. Being a language used in multiple disciplines, so I can try out a few projects in different areas
- 2. Being a good beginner langauge, to refresh my knowledge of programming concepts
- 3. They use it at the school that I work at, so I would be able to better support the staff and students while I am still working there

- 👀 I also think a possible direction for me would be to combine what I know from SysAdmin with what I am learning in Software Engineering. I.e looking into DevOps careers and even introducing it at my current job. 

- 🌱 So that's where I'm at for now. Powering through my assignments and backlog at work.

- 💞️ As I progress, I would love to collaborate on pretty much anything, to get a feel of what I am really into, and to realise where to go next.

- 📫 How to reach me ... via email, pedro47.tardis@hotmail.co.uk - "Would you like all the Jelly Babies". yes, yes I would.
